Problems to revisit (perhaps a slicker way to do it?):
4: largest palindrome product
9: works, but not super robust (more than one value of b that can form a pythagorean triplet with a given value of a)
12: problem with primeFactor routine, incorrectly returns prime factors for triangle number 12375 (76576500)
